Summary: Why kbrwn.com is a redirect

After finally getting this page set up properly I was quite excited to use my own URL (kbrwn.com). I purchased it from NameCheap and followed the documentation on how to set up the CNAME record properly. Unfortunately there is a significant performance hit after the set up. The page often takes 5-10 extra seconds or just doesn't load at all. So for now, kbrwn.com will just be a redirect to kbrwn.github.io. I hope to find a way to resolve this in the future.

This may be because of the recent DDOS attack that github has been dealing with. If it turns out to be the reason Iâ€™ll probably switch back to the proper set up.
